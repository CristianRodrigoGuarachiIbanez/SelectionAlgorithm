#Selection Tools for Blender with Python
**this project was developed to implement a A* Search Algorithm as a extension of the selection tools in blender. The selection algorithm was written in python 3.9. and was tested in blender 2.9.3**

#Installation 
**- the first step to running the algorithm is installing or updating Python on the local computer. There are a multitude of installation methods: you can download official Python distributions from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/), install from a package manager, and even install specialized distributions for scientific computing, Internet of Things, and embedded systems. A very comprehensive Tutorial to install python could be found [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).**
**- the blender installation could be done following the instruction on the [documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/getting_started/installing/index.html)**

#How to use it
