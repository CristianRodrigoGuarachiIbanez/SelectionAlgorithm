# Selection Tools for Blender with Python
**this project was developed to implement a A* Search Algorithm as a extension of the selection tools in blender. The selection algorithm was written in pure python with the version 3.9.2 and was tested in blender 2.9.3.
The core of this algorithm is the implementation of a pure pythonic data structure to handle the gathered blender specific data structures like Vertices, Loops, Edges or Faces. This data structure represents the current status to be expanded in a A* Algorithm and provides a handy way to compare expanded states and order them in a priority queue.  

## Installation 
- the first step to running the set of algorithms is installing or updating Python on the local computer. There are a multitude of installation methods: you can download official Python distributions from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/), install from a package manager, and even install specialized distributions for scientific computing, Internet of Things, and embedded systems. A very comprehensive Tutorial to install python could be found [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

- the blender installation could be done following the instruction on the [documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/getting_started/installing/index.html)**
